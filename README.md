# Skin_cancer_classsification
The project focuses on developing an skin cancer classification system using a Convolutional  Neural Network (CNN) trained on an online dataset.
The problem is to accurately and efficiently distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions from dermoscopic images. 
The key challenges include like ensuring the model can generalize well to unseen data and handle variations in skin types, lighting conditions, and camera qualities. 
The dataset comprises labeled images of benign and malignant skin lesions obtained from online sources. 
The project involves data collection, pre-processing, CNN architecture design, model training, performance evaluation and project documentation. 
The trained CNN model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions.
